        "    - Tuples ensure data integrity through immutibility, once they are created its contents/data type can not be changed. This means no adding or removing elements. This immutability protects the data from accidental or unauthorized modification, especially when passing data around functions or between parts of a program\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "    - A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, also known as a dictionary or map. It stores data in key-value pairs, where each key is mapped to a specific memory location (or index in an array) using a hash function. This hash function takes the key as input and produces an integer value (the hash code), which is then used to determine the storage location of the corresponding value. The primary advantage of hash tables is their ability to provide very fast average-case time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Hash Tables Relate to Dictionaries in Python:\n",
        "Python's built-in dictionaries (dict) are implemented using hash tables. When you create a dictionary and add key-value pairs, Python internally uses a hash table to store and retrieve this data efficiently\n",

        "    - list is an orderd collection of elements that can be of any data types in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "    - Strings in Python are immutable — meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed. If you try to modify it, Python will create a new string object instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Are Strings Immutable in Python?\n",
        "1.Data Integrity and Safety: Immutable strings prevent accidental changes\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "    - Dictionaries in Python offer several advantages over lists — especially when you need to associate data with unique keys and access it quickly.\n",

        "Dictionaries are ideal when:\n",

        "Tuples are immutable, Once a tuple is created, its size and contents cannot be changed.\n",

        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "    - A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where one or more values are themselves dictionaries. This allows you to represent complex, hierarchical data structures using key-value pairs.\n",

        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "    - Dictionaries are considered \"unordered\" because they do not guarantee a specific, predictable sequence for their elements, and instead, they are optimized for fast retrieval of values based on their associated keys, not their position. This fundamental characteristic means that data retrieval relies entirely on key-based access.\n",
